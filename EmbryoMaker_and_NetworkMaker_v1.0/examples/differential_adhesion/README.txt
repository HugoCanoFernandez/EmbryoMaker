DIFFERENTIAL ADHESION SIMULATION

Starting with a group of scattered mesenchymal cells, these will move preferentially to places where
cell contacts have maximum adhesivity. Regulatory molecule 1 works as a cell adhesion molecule with high
homotypic adhesivity and low heterotypic adhesivity. Regulatory molecule 2 is a cell adhesion molecule
with low homotypic adhesivity and high heterotypic adhesivity. Cells expressing regulatory molecule 1 will
prefferentially contact to other cells with regulatory molecule 1. Cells expressing regulatory molecule 2
will prefferentially contact cells with regulatory molecule 1.
