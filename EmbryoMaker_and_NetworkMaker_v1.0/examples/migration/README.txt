CELL MIGRATION SIMULATION

A group of mesenchymal cells are in contact with a flat epithelium on one side. Regulatory molecule 1
is expressed on the epithelium following a concentration gradient and works as an adhesion molecule.
Mesenchymal cells have high adhesion for regulatory molecule 1 and will preferentially move to places
its concentration is higher. Thus, over time, mesenchymal cells move over the epithelium following
the adhesivity gradient.
