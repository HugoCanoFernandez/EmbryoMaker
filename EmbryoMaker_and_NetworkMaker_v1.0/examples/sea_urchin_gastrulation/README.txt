SEA URCHIN GASTRULATION SIMULATION

A hollow spheric epithelium lies within a rigid cover of extracellular matrix. Some
cells in the vegetal pole express regulatory molecule 1 on the apical side. Regulatory
molecule 1 induces apical contraction and extracellular matrix secretion. Both cell
behaviors contribute to the invagination of the vegetal pole.
