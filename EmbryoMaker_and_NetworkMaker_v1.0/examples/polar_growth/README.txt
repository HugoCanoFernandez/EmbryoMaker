POLAR GROWTH SIMULATION

A flat epithelium is polarized by a gradient of regulatory molecule 1. Cell growth is
polarized so cells will elongate on the direction of the gradient. Cell division is
also polarized by the gradient, thus the plane of division will be normal to the 
direction of the gradient.
