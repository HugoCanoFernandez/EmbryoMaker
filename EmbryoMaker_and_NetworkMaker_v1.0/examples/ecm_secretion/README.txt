ECM SECRETION SIMULATION

Simulation with a flat epithelium above a thin layer of mesenchymal cells. The central epithelial cells 
start secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) into the space between the epithelium and the mesenchym. ECM 
will push mesenchymal cells downwards and epithelial cells upwards, thus deforming both tissues. Regulatory
molecule 4 is expressed on the basal side of the central epithelial cells and regulates the localized
secretion of ECM. Regulatory molecule 1 is continually being accumulated on the basal side of the secreting
cells and is secreted alongside with the ECM, working as an extracellular adhesion molecule.
